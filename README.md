# RIP_v2
## run rip_v2.py on command line 7 times with configuration file from router1.txt to router7.txt
- for Windows: python rip_v2.py router1.txt
- for Linux: python3 rip_v2.py router1.txt

## Note: do not just copy & paste the code for your assignment, think first and improve then. Thanks.

## PS: So sad about mark of assignment. Some parts need to be fixed.
- entries should not be prepopulated in entrytable by configure file.
- metric need to be checked before processing
- forget to check port # range
